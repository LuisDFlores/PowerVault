# PowerVault

This is a fullstack application built on the foundations of Node.js and JS. The templating language EJS was used and was styled with tailwind css and css customizations. Passport Js was used to authenticate. Express was used to handle the routes. The MVC model was implemented not only to optimize and edit faster, but to practice optimal coding conventions. Mongo DB alongside moongoose were used to store variables, sessions, logins and posts. 

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, mongoDB, Tailwind,

## Optimizations

To be able to enable the posts to be videos. To enable the feature of featured posts, where the posts with most likes are hosted on a seperate page.
